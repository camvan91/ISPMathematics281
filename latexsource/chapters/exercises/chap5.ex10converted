\begin{enumerate}

\item   Consider the surface consisting of the three faces
of the unit cube in the first octant which lie in the
coordinate planes.   Assume that the normals are chosen to
point into the first octant.   Determine the orientation
of the boundary of each of the three faces and verify that
cancellation occurs as described in the proof of
Stokes's Theorem along common edges.
